# Portfolio Website - React + Vite

This is a personal portfolio website built with React and Vite, showcasing my projects and professional work.

## Version Control & Collaboration

### Code Version Control (Git)
This project uses Git for version control, following professional development practices:
- All code changes are tracked through Git commits with descriptive messages
- Version history allows tracking of feature development and bug fixes
- Enables collaboration in team contexts through branching and merging strategies
- Repository hosted on GitHub for accessibility and backup

### Design Version Control (Figma)
For graphic design work and brand assets, we utilized Figma as our version control and collaboration platform:
- **Brand Guide Development**: Created a comprehensive brand guide collaboratively in Figma
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple team members worked simultaneously in a single Figma file
- **Version History**: Figma's built-in version history tracked all design iterations and changes
- **Design Documentation**: Design decisions, color schemes, typography, and component specifications documented in the Figma file
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Shared design prototypes and brand guidelines with stakeholders directly through Figma links
- **Asset Management**: All graphic assets organized and maintained in a central Figma file, ensuring consistency across the project

This approach demonstrates industry-standard practices for managing both code and design assets in professional team environments.

## Technical Stack

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
