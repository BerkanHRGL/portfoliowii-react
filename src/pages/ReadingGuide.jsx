            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>Looking at my progress this semester, I'm happy with how I've been able to combine my interest in design with technical development skills. Working on the Ducks on Fire project has taught me a lot about the full process from research to final product.</p>
            <p>What went well was my ability to stay organized and break down big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. I also got better at asking for feedback and actually using it to improve my work.</p>
            <p>What could be better is my time management, sometimes I spend too much time perfecting small details instead of focusing on the bigger picture first. I also want to get better at explaining my design decisions to others.</p>
            <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
            <p>For the rest of the semester, I want to focus on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improving my project planning and time management skills</li>
              <li>Getting better at presenting and explaining my work to others</li>
              <li>Expanding my knowledge of professional tools like Photoshop, Illustrator and Unreal Engine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I want to continue being curious and trying new approaches, but also become more efficient in my workflow. My goal is to become someone who can handle complex projects independently while also being a valuable team member.</p>
